# Mail-Merge-from-Docs-to-Pdf-Apps-scripts

  Documentation for my intern in PT.Rentokil Initial Indonesia as an IT.
Making Mail merge from Docs to PDF using data from their DB. The purpose why i making this code is for making their job easier and in some case the IT Team have a big order for their branch they can using this to make a lot handover letter more easier. The main reason why i making this on Google Apps Scripts because i have to use google envoirement so the security in guarentee.

  So how this code works is first we need to provide the code the template of the handover letter so the code can replace the placeholder that already set in the template document. So the code is replacing the placeholder that aready listed in table an will generate docs based on tototal rows in the data. after all the docs generate it will be converted to pdf using the cdn an merge it to 1 pdf with all the pdf already generate it. the reason why i merge it to pdf first not after generate docs because the footer will change for the first docs if not change to pdf first.

  so yeah i think that already conlude all of my code function.
